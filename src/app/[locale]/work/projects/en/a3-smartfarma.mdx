## Overview

In this project, I developed an AI-powered digital assistant named SmartFarma, designed to support pharmacists in delivering more accurate medication recommendations and dosage guidance. The application integrates a custom chatbot capable of understanding 150+ symptom patterns, aiming to streamline the diagnostic process and improve pharmacists’ efficiency by minimizing errors in medicine recommendation.

## Key Features

    - **Symptom-based Medication Recommendations**: The chatbot analyzes symptom descriptions from patients to suggest appropriate medications, achieving a high diagnostic accuracy rate of 81.54%, surpassing initial benchmarks.
    - **Enhanced Diagnostic Algorithm**: Developed and fine-tuned machine learning algorithms for the chatbot that increased diagnostic reliability, reducing prescription-related errors by 40%.
    - **Data-Driven Personalization**: Leveraged historical patient data stored in MariaDB to enable personalized treatment recommendations based on previous cases, ensuring consistency and relevance in recommendations.
    - **Real-Time API Integration**: Integrated with OpenAI API to expand the knowledge base, allowing the chatbot to provide real-time insights and reference verified medical information.

## Technologies Used

    - **Python**: For backend development and natural language processing.
    - **MariaDB**: For secure data storage and retrieval of patient data and symptom records.
    - **Postman**: For testing API endpoints and optimizing chatbot responses.
    - **OpenAI API**: To enhance the chatbot’s response accuracy and expand its knowledge base with reliable, up-to-date information.

## Challenges and Learnings

One major challenge was achieving high diagnostic accuracy with a limited dataset of symptoms. I tackled this by optimizing the model and implementing symptom pattern recognition, which helped the chatbot outperform standard benchmarks like GPT-3 and biomedical-ner-all. Additionally, fine-tuning the AI model to account for diverse patient inputs was a learning experience that significantly improved its accuracy and usability.

## Outcome

SmartFarma has become a valuable tool for pharmacists, increasing efficiency and reducing diagnostic errors. The AI chatbot provides reliable medication recommendations based on comprehensive symptom analysis, leading to a more streamlined pharmacy workflow. The project highlights the potential of AI in healthcare applications, bridging the gap between patient-reported symptoms and professional recommendations.
