## Overview

In this project, my focus was to develop a YOLO-based object detection model to improve on-shelf product availability in retail environments for a global food and beverage client. By creating a robust pipeline for data annotation, preprocessing, and mobile optimization, the project aimed to enhance real-time inventory tracking and ensure product availability on shelves. Additionally, I designed a user-centric mobile interface for seamless integration of YOLO-based detection features, providing store managers with a powerful tool for efficient inventory management.

## Key Features

    - **YOLO Model Integration**: Implemented and fine-tuned six versions of the YOLO algorithm (YOLOv5-nano, YOLOv6-nano, YOLOv7-tiny, and YOLOv8-nano) to determine the best fit for on-shelf product detection, with an emphasis on accuracy and inference speed.
    -	**Data Annotation and Preprocessing**: Managed the annotation and preprocessing pipeline for over 10,000 images across 506 unique product classes, creating a diverse and representative dataset to ensure high detection accuracy.
    -	**Mobile Optimization: Adapted models** for mobile deployment, leveraging MobileNetV3 for reduced model size and faster inference, enabling real-time inventory tracking on low-cost mobile devices.
    -	**UI/UX Design for Mobile App**: Designed an intuitive UI/UX for the mobile application that incorporated real-time detection results, allowing store managers to quickly identify out-of-stock items and enhance in-store inventory workflows.

## Technologies Used

    - **YOLOv5 - YOLOv8**: For object detection model variations, tested across multiple lightweight versions optimized for mobile.
    - **MobileNetV3**: To achieve model efficiency and compatibility with mobile devices through quantization (INT8 and FP16) and pruning techniques.
    - **LabelImg**: For efficient annotation and management of large datasets, integrated with custom preprocessing pipelines.
    - **Figma**: For mobile UI/UX design, ensuring the application interface was optimized for ease of use and quick adoption by store managers.

## Challenges and Learnings

The primary challenge was balancing detection accuracy with model efficiency to support real-time performance on mobile devices. This required careful consideration of model architecture choices, as well as optimization techniques such as quantization and pruning. Additionally, working with a large dataset of over 10,000 images across 506 classes presented unique challenges in data management and annotation quality control, which were addressed through a structured annotation and validation process.

## Outcome

The YOLO-based detection system was successfully deployed, reducing time spent on manual inventory checks by up to 60%. The mobile application, with its user-friendly interface, has been well-received by store managers, improving their ability to maintain optimal product availability. The project demonstrated the effectiveness of combining model efficiency with intuitive UI/UX design for a seamless, real-time solution that bridges the gap between AI technology and practical retail needs.
