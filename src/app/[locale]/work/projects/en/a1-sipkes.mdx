## Overview

In this project, we developed a scalable and user-centered health profile information system called SIPKES for local communities. Using Laravel for backend development and Bootstrap for frontend, the system was designed to manage, monitor, and present health-related data efficiently. SIPKES enables community health workers to streamline patient data entry, health records tracking, and reporting, thereby ensuring accurate, accessible, and up-to-date health profiles. The project focused on enhancing user experience for community health workers, providing ease of navigation, and ensuring secure data handling.

## Key Features

    1.	**Patient Management Module**: Built a comprehensive patient data management module where health workers can create, update, and view patient records. The system allows for secure, role-based access to patient information.
    2.	**Health Examination Records**: Enabled structured data entry for health examinations, such as blood pressure, blood sugar levels, and other vital statistics, which can be accessed and filtered by health metrics and patient demographics.
    3.	**Dashboard and Analytics**: Developed a dashboard for health metrics overview, showing statistics such as the number of patients, total examinations conducted, and trends by demographics. This feature assists health workers in identifying patterns and monitoring health indicators in the community.
    4.	**User Authentication and Role Management**: Integrated Keycloak to handle secure login and role-based access control, ensuring that users have access to features according to their responsibilities (Admin, Health Worker, or Patient).
    5.	**Responsive Design**: Implemented a responsive UI with Bootstrap to provide a seamless experience across devices, enabling health workers to use SIPKES on both desktops and tablets.
    6.	**Documentation and User Guide**: Created a user manual to facilitate easy onboarding, covering step-by-step instructions on data entry, record management, and accessing health reports.

## Technologies Used

    1. **Laravel**: For robust backend management and API handling.
    2. **Keycloak**: For secure, role-based authentication and authorization.
    3. **Bootstrap**: For responsive UI components.
    4. **MySQL**: For reliable data storage and retrieval.
    5. **Figma**: For collaborative design prototyping and UI development.

## Challenges and Learnings

One of the primary challenges was ensuring that the user interface catered to a non-technical audience while meeting data security standards. We achieved this by focusing on simple navigation flows, using accessible design patterns, and reinforcing data privacy measures through role-based access controls with Keycloak. Another challenge involved managing dynamic health data. This was addressed by creating adaptable data models that could accommodate a range of health metrics, ensuring the system remains flexible for future additions or modifications.

## Outcome

SIPKES has become a crucial tool for community health profiling, enabling faster data entry, consistent record-keeping, and real-time access to health metrics. By providing a centralized platform for health data management, the system has significantly reduced administrative tasks, improved data accuracy, and supported health workers in monitoring community health trends effectively. The system is now actively used by multiple health teams across local communities, enhancing their ability to provide proactive health care.
